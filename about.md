 ## Read the LOD is a grassroots LOD initiative that organizes reading-and-discussion clubs around relevant contemporary Linked Data and Semantic Web documents.

#### Why?

- to read everything you always wanted but never took up time for,
- to be able to ask those questions that have been bothering you,
- to share ideas, strategies, motivational spins, use cases and components,
- and to keep building the community.

#### Where, when and what?

Check out our [ReadtheLOD chat channel](https://chat.semantic.works/#/room/#readthelod:chat.semantic.works) to find out more about the next reading club!
Polls will be posted on here to determine the topic and date of the next reading club.  
You can also sign up as a [member](https://readthelod.org/members) to get notified about new polls and receive reading club notes.

More information on the planning of reading clubs is available [here](https://readthelod.org/readingclubs).
